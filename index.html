      <strong>Web Development</strong> is a passion. I love it but, It has been
      one of the hardest things I have ever done. When you learn something that
      is unlike anything you have ever done it is extremely challenging.
    </p>
    <h2>
      There are many things that I have learned during this process so far.
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be <em><u>Patient</u></em> with yourself.
      </li>
      <li>Practice, Practice, Practice</li>
      <li>
        <strong><u>Always</u></strong> commit your code
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My top goals for when I become a Professional Web Developer</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Learn as many new skills as I can</li>
      <li>Show my value in my new position</li>
      <li>Create amazing flawless websites</li>
    </ol>
